The original [_Java FX Address Book tutorial_](https://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-tutorial/ ) is from _Marco Jakob_ based on Eclipse with _Oracle JDK 8_.
Many people all over the world have been reading the tutorial from _Marco Jakob_ and gave very positive feedback.
Unfortunately the tutorial has not been maintained to later versions of JDK and Java FX.

This [tutorial](https://github.com/mbachmann/java-fx-address-book) is based on  **JDK 16** with **modular Java** and **Java FX 16**. Make sure your tool stack is properly installed.
For installing a _Java Development Environment_ based on **Jet Brains IntelliJ** you can refer to this [tutorial](https://github.com/mbachmann/java-development-environment-installation)

This tutorial walks you through designing, programming and deploying an address application. This is how the final application will look like:
