The original [_Java FX Address Book_](https://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-tutorial/ )  tutorial has been created by _Marco Jakob_ based on Eclipse with _Oracle JDK 8_.
Many people all over the world have been reading the tutorial and gave very positive feedback.
Unfortunately the tutorial has not been maintained to later versions of JDK and Java FX.

This updated [tutorial](https://github.com/mbachmann/java-fx-address-book) is based on  **JDK 17** with **modular Java**, **Java FX 17** and **Maven**. Make sure your tool stack is properly installed.
For installing a _Java Development Environment_ based on **Jet Brains IntelliJ** you can refer to
this [tutorial](https://github.com/mbachmann/java-development-environment-installation). The configuration
of Eclipse can be found [here](readme/eclipse.md).

The _Address Book Tutorial_ walks you through designing, programming and deploying an address application.
This is how the final application will look like:
